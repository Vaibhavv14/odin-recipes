            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><em>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.
                Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</em></p>

                <h4><strong>Steps:</strong></h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Marinate the chicken:
                        Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.
                        
                        Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.</li>
                    <li>Soak cashews and almonds:
                        Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe</li>
                    <li>Cook the chicken:
                        Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.
                        
                        Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.</li>    
                    <li>Start making the sauce:
                        Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes.
                        
                        Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.
                        
                        Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</li>    
                    <li>Puree the sauce with the nuts:
                        Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</li>    
                    <li>Finish the dish:
                        Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.
                        
                        As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>    
                    <li>Rest the butter chicken:
                        Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</li>    
                    <li>Serve:
                        Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.
                        
                        You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</li>
